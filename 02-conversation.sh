echo "Mark:: Actually, I changed jobs a few months ago. I’m at a startup now. It’s a lot more work, but I’m really enjoying the challenge."

echo "Mark:: Saturday is perfect. Let’s meet at that new café downtown around 3:00 PM."
echo "Sarah:: Sounds like a plan. I’ll see you then!" 
echo "Mark:: See you Saturday. Take care!"
